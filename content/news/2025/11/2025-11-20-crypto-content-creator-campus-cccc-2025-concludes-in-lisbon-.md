Lisbon, Portugal, November 20th, 2025, Chainwire

The

Crypto Content Creator Campus (CCCC) 2025

wrapped up a successful, sold-out three-day event in Lisbon, Portugal, from November 14 to 16, 2025. Hosted at the iconic Carlos Lopes Pavilion , the campus united top creators and innovators to shape the future of content creation within the Web3 and crypto sphere.

Day 1 of the event showcased the new era of influence, AI-driven monetisation, and creator-led crypto adoption. Key themes highlighted the evolution of affiliate marketing, AI-powered monetisation, and masterclasses in audience attention and authenticity.

Ben Zhou

,

Bybit

Co‑Founder & CEO, delivered the headline keynote, “Empowering the New Age of Affiliate Marketing,” offering a candid look into how affiliate marketing has transformed. Zhou reminded creators of the fundamentals: attention, value, and conversion, emphasising that compelling stories, strong thumbnails, aspirational lifestyle content, and consistent value delivery remain the creator’s responsibility. Looking ahead to 2025–2030, he highlighted the “Age of Compliance and Finfluencers” , noting that as crypto becomes a regulated global financial system, the creators who build for the long term will be the ones who shape its future.

The centerpiece panel, “Smart Monetization with AI,” featuring

Sergej Loiter

,

Nick Tran

, and

Tom Schmidt

, explored how AI is reshaping earning models. The unanimous consensus was that “AI is not a threat, but an equaliser. It gives creators the tools to catch up, scale up, and compete globally”. Speakers stressed that creators must think of their content as a product: audience-first, data-driven, and long-term , and urged creators to rethink platforms, using them as one huge ecosystem rather than silos.

Nuseir Yassin

(

Nas Daily

) delivered a masterclass on influence, credibility, and community-driven trading , mapping the state of social media monetisation. Yassin’s message was that content creation now demands both authenticity and velocity , advising creators to triple their content output with AI and localise everything to reach people’s hearts.

Day 2 continued to deliver compelling masterclasses and cultural conversations. The day opened with a live Creator House Judging Panel where top industry figures evaluated rising content creators. Panelists, including

,

Nick Tran

,

Nick Puckrin

, and

Musa Tariq

judged teams on narrative originality, platform savvy, and monetization potential. This session reinforced the Campus’s mission to develop a new generation of cross-platform creators grounded in influence, integrity, and craft.

A key highlight was an intimate Fireside Chat with

Dr. Maye Musk

, titled “Monetizing a Personal Brand into Durable Income”. Drawing from her decades of experience, Musk emphasized that the foundation of any lasting personal brand lies in authenticity , stating: “Stay true to yourself – why would you change?”.

Immediately following, Musk was joined by

Musa Tariq

, former marketing executive at

Airbnb

,

Apple

, and

Nike

, and

Philippe Ben Mohamed

, Head of Digital Innovation at

Tomorrowland

, for a panel on “Realising Monetization in the New Era.” The conversation explored how creators can sustainably and ethically monetize their communities. Tariq noted, “Content creators should consider themselves entrepreneurs with the opportunity of multiple streams of income” , while Mohamed emphasized a year-round strategy: “We aim to develop full 365-day plans for creators, true ecosystems, not short bursts of engagement”. He also stressed the importance of differentiation in an increasingly saturated industry.

Day 2 underscored a key truth: authenticity isn’t just an advantage, it’s essential. In a landscape shaped by AI, platform evolution, and cultural shifts, the creators who stay rooted in their identity, values, and communities will be the ones who define the next decade of influence.

The campus closed with a cocktail reception and a gala awards ceremony, celebrating standout creators and teams for achievements in innovation, education, community-building, and cultural expression. As this year’s campus concludes, CCCC looks ahead to 2026, where the community will continue to evolve with sharper tools, stronger platforms, and more sustainable monetisation models
